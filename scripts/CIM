# Description:
# This is an extremely simple script for toggleing input method (or, changing
# ibus engine) between default eng_Us & Avro; written to use with minimal window
# managers that does not come with a systray (or, if you chose not to) i.e. Suckless's dwm.
#
# I don't bash much, I looked at scripts that others made & learned the basic
# concepts off them.

#!/bin/bash

# Add all the input methods that you want to toggle.
# Yous can get all the available ibus engines (or simply, input methods) by running
# ibus list-engine

declare -a options=(
"xkb:us::eng"
"ibus-avro"
)

# dmenu prompt to choose options
input=$(printf '%s\n' "${options[@]}" | dmenu -fn 'NotoSansMono Nerd Font:size=11' -nb '#282828' -nf '#c2c2c2' -sb '#c2c2c2' -sf '#282828' -i -l 5 -p 'Choose Keyboard:')


# Changing ibus engine to our selected method
ibus engine $input
